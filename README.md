### Technical Details

---
The Project uses AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) Algorithms to Encrypt the plain data which will be embedded into the image.
- AES (Advanced Encryption Algorithm)
  - Cipher BlockChain Method
  - 128-bit key
  - 10 Rounds

After Encrypting plain data, encrypted data will be embedded into image by LSB Method
- Image Steganography
  - LSB (Least Significant Bit) Method
    - Storing Data from LSB Bit of every pixel.
